# Concept
boardsport AR training tool. Simboard uses the property of [Gyroscopic Procision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty9QSiVC2g0 "Gyroscopic Procision") to give the user the ability to pivot in 360.

Simboard is a low inpact, build it yourself balance board system. In order to simulate the transitional force of a wave a centrifugal flywheel is integrated into the base so the user can direct and pivot off this angular momentum.

A goal in Simboard is to use a combination of off the shelf and rapid manufactured parts; 3D printed carbon fiber, laser cut aluminum and steel. Similar to a drone build with a low barrier of enrty.

As a simple boilder plate for iteration we are exploring optinons for on chip AI systems such as [SensorTile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tNwY5EGc9Q "SensorTile") and or other edge / cloud enabled chips such as the [Particle Argon](https://store.particle.io/products/argon "Particle Argon") or [AZ3166 IoT](https://amzn.to/2yH5dZ3 "AZ3166 IoT")
